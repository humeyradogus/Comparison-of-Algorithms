# Comparison-of-Algorithms

About the program;
This program compares two sorting algorithms: insertion sort and merge sort. 
For each algorithm, there is a counter and counts how many times a comparison
is made to sort the array.  To implement this logic, integer arrays of 1000 
and 10000 elements created with random values inside and the number of comparisons
in both 1000 ELEMENT array and 10000 ELEMENT array is made.

The output of the program should be like given below;
